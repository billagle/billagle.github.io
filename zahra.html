		<h1>About this song</h1>
		<h3>This song was my only way of showing how much I was touched by the story of a little girl who lived close to Hickory North Carolina. All situations where the stronger hurt the weaker hurts me badly but for some reason this little one rocketed right into my wiring and soul. Those involved in searching for her and those in law enforcement who were so dedicated to the case were simply amazing. They will always have my respect.</h3>
