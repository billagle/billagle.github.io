description: I really enjoyed recording this new project and in many ways this project was different from the first three. The CD contains some of my new music that is somewhat reflective. <em>Winkler’s Creek</em> for example, goes back to times spent with family or friends on a creek near my home and <em>And Me</em> follows some key events in my life. I recorded seven original songs for this project and for the first time I decided to record a few of my favorite songs by artists that I greatly respect. Part of the joy in taking on this project was working with musicians who I had collaborated with on other projects, while at the same time meeting new people who contributed to the album. This project was done with the help of a new engineer and co-producer, Jeremiah Clever. He brought a great deal of talent and skill to the table and together we were able to experiment with different sounds until we had what I consider to be one of my best projects. My wife Janice sings vocals on <em>Helplessly Hoping</em> and <em>Sometimes</em>. My son Tanner took the vocal lead on <em>Mad World</em>. Other son Logan made all the changes to the original cover art and has been a big help on all things digital. My daughter Kylie is working hard on the violin – so it’s only a matter of time!
