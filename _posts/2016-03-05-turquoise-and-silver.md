description: This was my third project and it was conceived at a point in my life when I was spending most of my time on the road. This was a special project to me because it included all original songs, <em>four favorites from past projects, and nine new songs</em>.  The title track, <em>Turquoise and Silver, Will & Bill, Directions, More Than Any Other, Sail Away, Before You Go</em>, and <em>Outlaw</em> are performed by Zan McLeod and myself.  Bert Hering co-wrote and performed on <em>Outlaw</em>. Janice had done a drawing that I liked and I decided to use it on the cover. <em>Turquoise & Silver</em> was one of my favorite projects.
