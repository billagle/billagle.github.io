description: <i>Lover’s Rain</i> was my first recording project. I was introduced to some very talented musicians by the TGS engineer, Steve Gronback.  Zan McLeod, who I met just before starting the project, has now played on all four of my projects. Chapel Hill was a great place to record and I returned there many times to perform. With the exception of “Galaxy” all of the music on this project was written back in the mountains of North Carolina. The cover picture was actually taken as a candid shot of me with my dog “Boo” in the backpack while the photographer and I searched for a place to shoot the cover. During the time this project was recording I was playing regularly with Tim Carter in a band called Whiskey Creek – a great college band that made no money. I wonder how many times that has happened?<br><br>Recently <i>Lover’s Rain</i> was re-mastered for CD. I hope you enjoying hearing it as much as I enjoyed recording it.
