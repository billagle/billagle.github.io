description: As <em>Lover’s Rain</em> was influenced by living in the mountains, <em>Captiva</em>, (my second project), was influenced by my love of the sea. I visited Captiva Island in Florida during a visit with my brother Jim, and was quite taken with the place.  I often played on the coast of North Carolina, and that is where I wrote songs like <em>Carolina Seas, One More Time, Tower,</em> and <em>Whiskey Bars</em>. On this project I worked with the same engineer at TGS Records and many of the same musicians who played on <em>Lover’s Rain</em>. There were also some new faces including Don Dixon who arranged the string sections on several songs including violin and cello. This project gave my music a different sound, which was both interesting and fun. Jerry Douglas played the dobro on <em>Whiskey Bars</em>, which became one of my favorites simply because of what he was able to add to the song. While recording <em>Captiva</em>, I was also producing a project in Boone and Chapel Hill. The singers from that project came to Chapel Hill and we were able to do some great background vocals. All in all, <i>Captiva</i> was a very unique project and I enjoyed working with everyone who contributed. <i>Captiva</i> was dedicated to my brother James and the good crew of the “Not Much”.
